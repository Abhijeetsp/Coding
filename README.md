# Coding


We will work on developing the skills for competitive programming I would recommend you to use c++ for the beginner or you can use the language of your choice. I have done the first 30 code of project Euler's problem in a very simple c language without using the library of STL or taking care about the name of variable, functions and etc just a simple C code. 

Later we have an example folder where we discuss techniques required for competitive programming like creating the recursive function instead of iterative lines of codes. How to chose the data structure which will efficiently solve the problem and many more.
